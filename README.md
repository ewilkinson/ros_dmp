DMP (Dynamic Motion Primivite)
==========================================

Simple Dynamic Motion Primitive ROS node code.

Generates DMP from ros bag files (specific to uBot robots) and creates a DMP for each joint. Currently does not support learning the DMP in the end effector space. Can learn both Rythmic and Discrete DMPs. 

ROS code is in general specific to the uBot platform.
